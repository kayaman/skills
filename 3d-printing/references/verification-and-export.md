## 1. Static check

```
python3 scripts/check_scad.py path/to/enclosure.scad
```

Catches unbalanced braces/brackets, missing `part` branches (including `check`),
tolerance or wall parameters, `ASSUMPTION` tags and asserts, huge `$fn`,
`minkowski()`, `use` without a local `EPS`, a `use`/`include` file that isn't beside
the project, and calls to modules or functions defined nowhere. That last one matters:
OpenSCAD skips an unknown module with a warning and the feature silently vanishes from
the STL. Not a substitute for rendering.

After any change to `enclosure_lib.scad`, render `assets/selftest.scad`
(`openscad -o selftest.stl selftest.scad`) before touching product files. After any
change to `scripts/check_stl.py`, run `scripts/test_check_stl.py`.

## 2. CLI rendering and export

```
# one part → STL (or .3mf)
openscad -o base.stl -D 'part="base"' enclosure.scad
openscad -o lid.3mf  -D 'part="lid"'  enclosure.scad

# stop on the first warning (e.g. undefined variable) — good for CI-style checks
openscad --hardwarnings -o base.stl -D 'part="base"' enclosure.scad

# preview image
openscad -o preview.png --imgsize=1200,900 --viewall --autocenter \
         --projection=p -D 'part="exploded"' enclosure.scad

# console output only (echo/assert messages)
openscad -o log.echo enclosure.scad
```

- **Renders must be clean.** Treat every WARNING as a defect —
  "Object may not be a valid 2-manifold" means the slicer is guessing. In 2021.01
  the render summary prints `Simple: yes` for a clean solid; `Simple: no` is the
  same defect. `ECHO:` lines are the model's own notes, not render warnings.
- An empty result is reported as "Current top level object is empty." and 2021.01
  exits with status 1 without writing a file. For `part = "check"` that is the pass.
- `-D var=value` overrides top-level variables (strings need quotes, escaped
  for the shell; on Windows `-D "part=\"lid\""`).
- PNG uses preview mode by default; add `--render` for an exact render.
- `--camera=tx,ty,tz,rx,ry,rz,dist` for fixed views.
- Development snapshots render far faster with the Manifold backend
  (`--backend=manifold` in recent snapshots; older snapshots used
  `--enable=manifold`). Stable 2021.01 doesn't have it.
- `scripts/export_parts.sh enclosure.scad [parts…]` wraps all of this: it writes
  `out/<name>_<part>.stl`, prints the design echoes (size, BOM, notes), runs the
  interference check, and writes assembly, exploded and section PNGs. It exits
  non-zero on a failed render, any render WARNING or `Simple: no`, or interference.
- CGAL in 2021.01 takes about a minute for a typical base; the lid takes seconds.
  Render parts in parallel when you have the cores.

## 3. Interference and fit checks

- `part = "check"` renders `intersection(){ base(); lid_world(); }`. The
  result must be **empty** — OpenSCAD reports an empty top-level object. Any
  solid is a collision; render it to see where.
- Extend the same idea to other pairs: board keepout box vs. standoffs/bosses,
  button caps vs. lid, battery vs. walls.
- Use `assert()` for numeric invariants (fits, minimums, build volume). They
  fail loudly in both GUI and CLI.
- `part = "section"` cuts the assembly in half to inspect lip clearance,
  standoff heights and cutout alignment.
- `%` ghost geometry (board, battery, display) shows fit in preview without
  being exported.

## 4. Visual checks

With a PNG or the user's screenshot, look for: cutouts aligned with
connectors on the board ghost, lid lip clearing bosses, no floating parts
(everything touches the base), text readable, vents clear of bosses and
cutouts, lid part lying flat (outer face at z = 0).

## 5. Pre-delivery checklist (reason through it when you can't render)

This expands the SKILL.md self-check into things to trace in the code:

1. Every tunable is a top-level parameter; derived values computed; profile values
   in the Process group match `manufacturing-profiles.md`.
2. Every `difference()` cutter overshoots by EPS (library `*_cut` modules do).
3. Board fits: cavity ≥ board + 2 × pcb_clear (+ connector overhang); stack height
   covers max(comp_top, wiring_top_h) + 2 mm; standoffs ≥ bottom stack (pin tails,
   comp_bot) + 1 mm, and ≥ 5 mm for pinned devkits.
4. Each cutout traces to board coordinates through its edge, meets a wall with no
   column zone, doesn't cross the lid split, and its plug can reach the socket
   (overmold recess set if needed; roof on openings wider than the bridge limit).
5. Columns: gusseted, filleted, fused to walls, ribs clear of the board, derive bore depth from the selected insert length plus documented relief; preserve
   the blind floor, avoid the PCB and components, and derive boss OD from bore plus
   twice the minimum radial wall. Size and space columns for the span.
6. Standoffs start at `floor_t − EPS`; no column passes through the board footprint.
7. Body and lid fit: a continuous tongue, lip, or lap, with the slip clearance on
   each mating face and one slip of depth past the tongue. A rim-to-rim plate fails
   even if the solids do not intersect. `part="check"` is empty, and a section
   shows the gap. The land beside the groove is still at least one extrusion.
8. Each part prints support-free in the stated orientation; bridges ≤ profile limit
   (or noted); teardrops on large horizontal holes.
9. Vents: chimney bands, slot ≤ 25 mm, pitch ≥ slot + wall, ≤ 4 mm if child/pet safe.
10. Sensors chambered per sensors.md; heat sources ≥ 15 mm (asserted); antenna
    keepout (asserted).
11. Fits the build envelope (asserted); tall parts flagged for a brim.
12. Every `part` value produces geometry, and `check` produces none.

## 6. Delivering in chat

- Deliver the complete `.scad`; ship `enclosure_lib.scad` alongside if the
  file `use`s it, or inline the modules into one file (preferred for users who
  paste into the OpenSCAD editor or an online renderer — say which you did).
- When file tools exist, write the files to the outputs and present them;
  include exported STL/3MF/PNG only if you actually rendered them. When the chat
  shows images, embed the exploded or section PNG: the user checks connector
  placement and fit faster from a picture than from a parameter list.
- Never claim a render/export succeeded if it didn't run. Say "not rendered
  here — run F6" when OpenSCAD isn't available.
- For follow-up edits, keep parameter names; list changed parameters.

## 7. Slicer hand-off notes (put in the reply)

Per part: orientation, "no supports", layer height (0.2 mm; 0.12–0.16 for fine
text), wall loops (6 on house PETG-CF; the insert boss is solid perimeters, not
dense infill), sparse infill 15–20% gyroid (cubic if the machine shakes; not grid
or lightning), brim for ABS/ASA, material temperatures from
the spool. Mention any pause-at-height for captured magnets/nuts with the Z
value.

## 8. FreeCAD (MCP) equivalents

No CLI exists for this backend; every check below is a Python call run through
`execute_code` (tool-choice rules: `references/freecad-design-and-export.md`).

- **Clean render** — after every boolean: `shape.isValid()` is True, `shape.isNull()`
  is False, `shape.Volume` is finite and > 0. There is no "Simple: yes/no" line;
  treat any `isValid() == False` or a zero/negative Volume as the defect it reports.
  A `doc.recompute()` error state on any object is a hard failure, the FreeCAD analog
  of `--hardwarnings`.
- **Interference check** — `inter = base_shape.common(lid_shape)`; pass is
  `inter.isNull() or inter.Volume < 1e-3`. BRep booleans rarely return an exactly-null
  shape the way OpenSCAD's CGAL kernel does — state this epsilon, don't assert exact
  zero. Extend `.common()` + Volume to other pairs (board keepout vs. bosses, cutout
  vs. wall) the same way §3 already recommends generically.
- **Export** — `Part.export([obj], "out.step")` for STEP, `Mesh.export([obj], "out.stl")`
  for STL/3MF. Check STL facet density on small-radius features (bosses, gussets)
  before calling it done — the default tessellation deflection can be coarse there.
- **Visual delivery** — a screenshot from `execute_code`'s own return, or an explicit
  `get_view(doc_name, view_name=...)` call. No PNG file is written the way
  `export_parts.sh` writes one; the screenshot is the delivered visual.
