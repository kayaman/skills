# Dimension and printing guidance for enclosure-maker

Maintained in the 3d-printing skill at references/enclosure-maker-agent.md;
copy this resource verbatim into the app's docs/printing-guidance.md when updating it.
This is focused guidance from the 3d-printing skill. It grants no
additional tools or filesystem access. User choices override house defaults.

## Native source and adjustable dimensions

Keep the existing Rhai project and stable named emit parts. Expose important
independent dimensions with param(...): wall/floor, bore diameter, insert length,
relief, boss height and radial wall, gusset dimensions, clearances and hole positions.
Derive mating features from shared inputs. Preserve imported helpers and parameter
names; use only APIs documented by this host. Do not convert the project to SCAD.

Use mm. Identify nominal size, per-side clearance, diameter compensation and final
CAD size. A circular female feature may use nominal male diameter + 2 * per-side
clearance + diameter compensation. A coupon-selected insert bore is already final
CAD size: do not add hole_comp again. Rectangular lid clearances apply per face.
Choose one owner for hole compensation, CAD or slicer, and document it.

## House profile and fasteners

Unless the user/project specifies another profile: A1 Mini, PETG-CF, 0.4 mm hardened
nozzle, 0.42 mm nominal extrusion width, 0.2 mm layers, 170 mm usable design envelope
per axis (180 mm machine volume). House starting targets: 2.52 mm shell wall,
3 mm floor/ceiling, 5 mm bridge, 40° target/45° maximum overhang from vertical,
0.25 mm per-side slip clearance and +0.15 mm general hole-diameter compensation.
These are uncalibrated design targets, not measured machine limits or strength
certification. Check actual slicer perimeter coverage. For a changed nozzle or
material, recompute dependent dimensions and revalidate fits.

Thread size alone does not specify an insert. Use the actual manufacturer/product
for bore shape, diameter, length, mouth treatment and installation guidance. The
house M3 example starts at final CAD bore 4.1 mm, length 5.7 mm, relief 1 mm, square
mouth, boss OD at least 9.5 mm and radial wall at least 2.5 mm. These are assumptions.
Compute effective boss OD as max(requested minimum, profile minimum, final bore +
2 * required radial wall), then derive placement clearances from it. Check material
beneath blind bores, screw engagement/bottom clearance and matching lid-hole centres.
Tie loaded columns into the shell with gussets and suitable root reinforcement.

Built-in hardware calls can fix bore sizes and tessellation. If those are unsuitable,
use documented primitives in project-local helpers with explicit dimensions; do not
invent overloads. Use at least 64 segments for functional circular holes on final
exports, preserving intentional hexagons. A raw shell operation on complex geometry
is not proof of constant wall thickness. A lid needs a locating register and explicit
clearance. Avoid support on mating surfaces; favour screwed closures for house
PETG-CF and assess load direction across layers.

## Print orientation and verification

Emit named printable parts; use view(...) for assembly/exploded/section compositions.
Keep print orientation distinct from assembly placement, and bed faces at z=0.
Read existing saved part transforms when reasoning about placement; never edit
.enclosure-maker metadata or repeat its offsets in code. Saved transforms also
apply to exports and may move a part off the bed.

Validate critical dimensions in source, sections and actual exports. Inspect closed
mesh topology, intended body count, bed position and envelope, then slicer layers
for thin walls, islands, bridge spans and overhangs. Sampled mesh checks do not prove
self-intersection freedom, strength or physical fit. A successful preview is not an
STL validation. Prefer correcting generated source to blindly accepting mesh repair.

Only claim checks actually performed with available tools. If this host has only
file-editing tools, use its live preview and report CLI/mesh/slicer/physical checks
as unverified. Do not call missing tools or relax permissions to claim completion.
Record printed calibration results with printer, nozzle, material, orientation and
slicer settings; without measurements, say the values are uncalibrated.
