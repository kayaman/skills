# Manufacturing profiles

A profile is the printer + material pair the part will actually be made on. It overrides
the generic numbers in SKILL.md. Load the default unless the user names a different one.

## Default: Bambu Lab A1 Mini + PETG-CF

Do not ask the user to confirm this profile. Use it unless they name another.

**Machine.** Bed-slinger (Y-moving bed), open frame, textured PEI plate.
Build volume 180 × 180 × 180 mm → design envelope **170 × 170 × 170 mm**.
Nozzle 0.4 mm hardened steel, extrusion width `ew = 0.42`, layer height 0.2 mm.

**Material behaviour to design around.** PETG-CF is stiff and dimensionally stable but
brittle and notch-sensitive — far lower elongation at break than unfilled PETG. It is
anisotropic and weakest in tension across layer lines. Bridges and overhangs droop more
than PLA. Holes come out undersized and the first layer spreads. HDT is roughly
75–85 °C, so it is not a high-temperature material. The carbon fill attenuates 2.4 GHz
more than neutral plastics.

### Geometry overrides

| Parameter | Value | Why |
|---|---|---|
| `wall` | `6 * ew` = 2.52 mm | 6 perimeters; brittle material needs section, not ribs alone |
| floor / ceiling | 3.0 mm (15 layers) | |
| max bridge | 5 mm | PETG-CF sags where PLA holds |
| max overhang | 45°, target 40° | |
| teardrop threshold | horizontal holes ≥ 5 mm | |
| bottom chamfer | 0.8 mm × 45°, every plate-touching edge | elephant foot |
| `hole_comp` | +0.15 mm on diameter | functional holes only, not cosmetic cutouts |
| internal fillet | R ≥ 1.0 mm, **everywhere** | a square internal corner is a crack initiator here |
| min insert boss OD | 9.5 mm for M3 | ≥ 2.5 mm plastic around the insert |
| gussets per column | 3 minimum, always root-filleted | |
| antenna keepout | 20 mm | CF attenuation |
| `tol` | press 0.15 / slip 0.25 / loose 0.40 | calibrate once, then freeze |

Wall must always be an integer multiple of `ew`. Do not round it to a pretty number.

### No elastic features

Snap fits, cantilever latches, living hinges and flexing tabs are **forbidden**. They
work in PLA and PETG, and they crack on the second open in PETG-CF. All closures are
screwed; all alignment is tongue-and-groove or dowel pins.

If a brief explicitly demands a clip: arm length ≥ 10 × thickness, root fillet ≥ 1.5 mm,
deflection ≤ 1.5% of arm length, and state the fatigue risk in the build notes.

### Load paths

Never let a screw load a single layer plane in tension. The pull-out path runs through
the column body, not through a flat lid flange — that flange is a stack of layer bonds
being peeled apart.

### Envelope and orientation

- Assert every part fits 170 × 170 × 170 mm. If it does not, split it and join with M3
  bolts plus ≥ 2 dowel pins (Ø 4 mm printed pockets, 0.20 mm clearance). Never specify
  glue: PETG bonds poorly with cyanoacrylate and has no practical solvent weld.
- Each part needs a flat face covering ≥ 60% of its footprint to print on, support-free.
- Bed-slinger: if a part's height exceeds 2.5 × its smallest footprint dimension,
  reorient it, widen the base, or split it — and call for a brim in the build notes.
- The bottom face takes the plate texture. Never put a gasket seat, a sealing surface or
  fine debossed detail there.

### Operator notes to include in BUILD NOTES

- Hardened nozzle is mandatory; CF abrades brass fast.
- Dry the filament before any long print — roughly 65 °C for 8 h. PETG is hygroscopic
  and the CF load makes it worse; wet filament produces brittle layer bonds, which is
  exactly the failure you do not want in a screw column.
- Do not run CF through the AMS Lite — feed from the spool holder to avoid abrading the
  filament path.
- Glue stick on the textured PEI acts as a release agent, not an adhesive. PETG bonds to
  bare PEI hard enough to damage the sheet.

## Adding a profile

When the user names a different printer or material, write a new section with the same
headings and the same override table. The fields that must be filled: build envelope,
`ew`, layer height, wall, max bridge, max overhang, teardrop threshold, `hole_comp`,
minimum internal fillet, insert boss OD, antenna keepout, `tol` triple, and whether
elastic features are allowed.

Common variations worth knowing:

- **0.6 mm hardened nozzle on the same A1 Mini.** Set `ew = 0.62`, recompute
  `wall = 4 * ew = 2.48`, and note that fewer, fatter perimeters actually improve part
  strength with filled materials. Recompute everything derived from `ew`; do not carry
  over the 0.4 mm numbers.
- **Unfilled PETG or PLA.** Elastic features become allowed; internal fillet can drop to
  R 0.5 mm; antenna keepout back to 15 mm. PLA's ~55 °C HDT makes it unsuitable for
  anything in a car, a window, or near a regulator.
- **ASA / ABS.** Enclosed printer only. Add shrinkage compensation (~0.5–0.7%) to all
  outer dimensions and expect warped large flat faces — design with ribs and avoid broad
  unbroken bottoms.

## Calibrating `tol`

Print one fit-test coupon per printer-material pair — a plate with pins at 0.10, 0.15,
0.20, 0.25, 0.30, 0.40 mm clearance — and pick the value that gives the fit you want by
hand. Feed that number into every project as `tol` and do not change it per project.
This single number is the most common cause of assemblies that worked last time and do
not fit now.
