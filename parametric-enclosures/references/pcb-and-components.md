## 1. Getting the board geometry

In order of reliability:
1. The user's own measurements or KiCad/EasyEDA files. From KiCad, export the
   Edge.Cuts layer as DXF/SVG (1:1, mm) and `import()` it for the outline;
   export the 3D board as STL and show it with `%import("board.stl")` for fit.
2. The manufacturer's mechanical drawing (Raspberry Pi, Arduino and Espressif
   publish them).
3. The table in §4 — good starting values; clones differ. Always tag them
   `// ASSUMPTION: verify with calipers`.

What you need: outline X×Y, thickness, hole Ø and centers (from the
bottom-left corner, top view), connector positions/sizes/overhang past the
edge, tallest part above and below.

## 2. Vertical stack-up (base floor upward)

```
floor_t                     profile value (3.0 on PETG-CF; ≥ 1.2 generic)
standoff_h                  ≥ 5 mm for pinned devkits; template:
                            max(standoff_min, bottom_stack_h + 1,
                            bottom_stack_h + 3.5 with keyholes)
pcb_t                       1.6 typical (1.0 Pico, ~1.4 Raspberry Pi)
comp_top                    tallest rigid component, measured
wiring_top_h                assembled connector + wire envelope above PCB top;
                            28 mm default for top-entry Dupont when unmeasured
top_stack_h                 max(comp_top, wiring_top_h), then + 2 mm closure margin
lid split                   template: the higher of the component stack and the tallest
                            cutout (with its lead-in and roof) + 1 mm
lid                         ceil_t + tongue/groove
```

Measure from the PCB surfaces, not from the header plastic. Soldered male pins commonly
leave about 3–4 mm below the board; use 4 mm when unmeasured and keep at least 1 mm
below them. A straight top-entry Dupont housing plus the first unstrained wire bend
commonly needs 22–28 mm above the PCB top. Use 28 mm by default because 15–20 mm often
fits the connector body but not the bend, so the lid compresses the leads or will not
seat. A lower value needs a measured, pre-bent and restrained harness.

Header geometry is not automatically symmetric. Record each row as an occupied board
edge (`x0`, `x1`, `y0`, `y1`), which PCB face carries the header spacer and Dupont
housing, and the projection beyond that edge. In the template,
`header_edge_clear = [x0, x1, y0, y1]` adds lateral room before `pcb_rot`; for example,
`[0, 12, 0, 0]` reserves 12 mm only beyond the board's `x1` edge. This is required for
one-sided headers and right-angle pins. Keep the local envelope out of a rail or stop;
do not enlarge all four sides or centre the board as a substitute.

## 3. Holding the board

| Method | When | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Standoffs + screws | board has holes | default; M2.5 for Raspberry Pi, M3 for most others; self-tap pilot 2.1 (M2.5) / 2.4 (M3) |
| Standoffs + heat-set inserts | board removed often | insert hole per vendor spec; standoff Ø ≥ insert hole + 3 |
| Pins (locating) + lid posts | quick, no screws | pin Ø = hole − 0.3; lid posts press the board with 0.2 mm interference |
| Floor rails + stops | board without holes (ESP32 DevKit, XIAO), top-loading box | the template's default when `mount_holes = []`: rails under the front/back edges at standoff height, a stop on each side that has a column zone; the lid limits lift to its headroom. Move or drop a rail (`rail_w`) where header pins run under the edge |
| Card-guide slots | board without holes, box that opens at one end | slot width = pcb_t + 0.3; rails 2 mm deep; a stop at the end |
| Snap clips over the board edge | holes absent, board rarely removed | see closures reference for strain |
| Header sockets on a carrier board | dev boards | the carrier gets the holes |

Keep standoff diameter clear of pads and components near the holes (check
keepout rings on the board; typically Ø 5–6 mm is safe for M3 holes).

## 4. Known board footprints (verify before printing)

Coordinates: origin at the bottom-left corner of the board in top view.

| Board | Outline (mm) | Mounting holes | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| Arduino Uno R3 / R4 | 68.6 × 53.3 | Ø3.2 at (14.0, 2.5), (15.3, 50.7), (66.1, 7.6), (66.1, 35.5) | USB and DC jack on the x = 0 edge and overhang it by ~6 mm; R3 USB-B is ~12 × 11 mm tall, R4 uses USB-C |
| Arduino Nano (classic/clones) | 18 × 45 | four small holes (~Ø1.8) near the corners | usually held by headers or rails; USB on a short edge (Mini-USB, micro or USB-C by clone) |
| Arduino Nano ESP32 / Every | 18 × 45 | as Nano | USB-C/micro on a short edge |
| ESP32 DevKitC (38-pin) | ≈ 54–55 × 28 | none | antenna at the short end opposite the USB; clones vary (48–58 × 25–28) |
| ESP32 30-pin DevKit clones | ≈ 51–52 × 28 | none (some have 4 × Ø2.5) | measure |
| Wemos D1 mini | 34.2 × 25.6 | none | USB on a short edge |
| Seeed XIAO (all variants) | 21 × 17.8 | none | USB-C on the short edge; castellated |
| Raspberry Pi 4 B / 3 B+ / 5 | 85 × 56 | M2.5, Ø2.7 at (3.5, 3.5), (61.5, 3.5), (3.5, 52.5), (61.5, 52.5) | USB/Ethernet stack ~16 mm tall and overhangs the x = 85 edge by ~2–3 mm; Pi 5 needs active cooling |
| Raspberry Pi Zero / Zero 2 W | 65 × 30 | M2.5, Ø2.75 at (3.5, 3.5), (61.5, 3.5), (3.5, 26.5), (61.5, 26.5) | ports on the long edge at y = 0 |
| Raspberry Pi Pico / Pico W / Pico 2 | 51 × 21 × 1.0 | Ø2.1, 47 × 11.4 pattern (2.0 mm from short edges, 4.8 from long edges) | USB on a short edge; Pico W antenna at the opposite end |

## 5. Connector cutouts

Size the opening = connector body + `cutout_clear` (0.5 mm) per side (+0.25 more and a
1 mm 45° lead-in on user-facing ports), corner radius = body radius + clearance.

In the template each cutout is
`[edge, pos, z, w, h, r, user_facing, overmold, overhang]`, all in board coordinates
read straight off the board drawing:

- `edge` is the board edge the connector sits on: `"x0"` (the edge at x = 0), `"x1"`,
  `"y0"` or `"y1"`. `pcb_rot` turns the board, which picks the wall each edge meets.
- `pos` is the connector centre along that edge (board y on an x-edge, x on a y-edge);
  `z` is its centre above the board top.
- `overhang` is how far the body sticks out past the board edge (Uno USB-B ≈ 6.2,
  DC jack ≈ 1.8, Pi 4 USB/Ethernet ≈ 2.5). The template moves the board in by it.

The template then lays the box out from the connectors: a wall that carries a
connector sits `pcb_clear` from the board, and the column zones take the other sides
(both X ends if they are free, else front and back, else every free side). A corner
column exists where at least one of its two sides has a zone, so connectors on two
adjacent walls (Raspberry Pi) leave three columns, and on three or four walls the
assert stops you: bring one connector out through the lid, move it, or place a column
by hand. Vents default to faces without connectors.

Typical bodies (verify):

| Connector | Body opening W × H (mm) | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| USB-C receptacle | 8.9 × 3.3, r 1.6 | plug overmold ~10–13 × 5.5–7 |
| Micro-USB | 7.8 × 3.0 | plug overmold ~10 × 6 |
| Mini-USB | 7.7 × 4.0 | |
| USB-A (single) | 13.2 × 5.8 | |
| USB-B | 12.2 × 11 | |
| DC barrel jack (PCB, 5.5/2.1) | ≈ 9 × 11 | panel-mount versions use a round hole — check the datasheet thread |
| RJ45 | 16 × 13.5 | with LEDs: extend window |
| 3.5 mm audio | Ø6–6.5 | |
| microSD socket | 12 × 2 slot | add a finger notch Ø10 below |
| Toggle / rocker switches, panel pots | per datasheet (e.g. 6 mm or 7 mm shaft holes; 7 mm pots use Ø7.2) | add an anti-rotation tab slot if the part has one |

**The USB plug trap.** The plug's overmold is wider than the socket. If the
socket sits back from the outer surface by more than ~1.5 mm, the overmold
hits the wall and the plug never seats. Fix one of two ways:
1. Place the board so the socket face is within 0.5 mm of the inner wall, and
   keep the wall ≤ 1.5 mm at the socket, or
2. Recess the outer face around the opening to overmold size + tol per side,
   leaving ≤ 1 mm of wall at the socket — the template does this when a cutout's
   `overmold` is set (needed on the 2.52 mm PETG-CF wall).
Say which one you used. The template's walls with connectors already sit
`pcb_clear` from the board edge; the recess handles the thick PETG-CF wall.

Cutouts must not cross the lid split line unless you design them as notches
split between base and lid. The template raises the split above the tallest cutout
(lead-in and roof included) and asserts it.

Openings wider than the profile's bridge limit get a 45° roof (`cutout_roof`), so
their top prints without sagging into the plug's path.

Raspberry Pi 4 B, from drawing RP-008343-DS (verify against the board; heights are
body tops above the PCB):

```
cutouts = [
    ["y0", 11.2, 1.6, 9.0, 3.2, 1.6, true, [12.5, 7.0], 0],  // USB-C power
    ["y0", 26.0, 1.5, 6.5, 3.0, 0.5, true, [11.0, 7.5], 0],  // micro-HDMI 0
    ["y0", 39.5, 1.5, 6.5, 3.0, 0.5, true, [11.0, 7.5], 0],  // micro-HDMI 1
    ["y0", 54.0, 3.0, 6.2, 6.2, 3.1, true, [], 0],           // 3.5 mm AV jack
    ["x1",  9.0, 8.0, 13.5, 16.0, 0.5, true, [], 2.5],       // USB 2.0 stack
    ["x1", 27.0, 8.0, 13.5, 16.0, 0.5, true, [], 2.5],       // USB 3.0 stack
    ["x1", 45.75, 6.75, 16.0, 13.5, 0.5, true, [], 2.5]      // Ethernet
];
```

That puts connectors on two adjacent walls: the template leaves the corner between
them without a column and screws the lid at the other three.

## 6. Antennas and keepouts

- Wi-Fi/BLE modules with PCB antennas (ESP32-WROOM, Pico W, XIAO): place the
  antenna end near a wall, not in a corner packed with parts.
- Keep metal outside the profile's antenna keepout (15 mm generic, 20 mm on PETG-CF):
  screws, heat-set inserts, batteries, magnets. Carbon-fibre/metal-filled filament
  attenuates by itself. The template asserts inserts against `antenna`.
- No metal enclosures; plastic walls ≤ 3 mm are nearly transparent at 2.4 GHz.
- External antenna (u.FL → SMA): SMA bulkhead hole Ø6.5 with a D-flat if the
  connector has one.
